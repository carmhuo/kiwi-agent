# GitHub Workflows Optimization Report

## üìã Executive Summary

Successfully optimized and enhanced the GitHub Actions workflows for the Kiwi SQL Generation Project. The optimization includes fixing critical issues, adding comprehensive security scanning, implementing automated dependency management, and creating a complete CI/CD pipeline.

## üîç Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Critical Dependency Installation Issues**
- **Problem**: Incorrect usage of `uv pip install -r pyproject.toml`
- **Solution**: Changed to proper `uv pip install -e ".[dev,test]"` syntax
- **Impact**: Workflows will now correctly install dependencies

### 2. **Test Path Mismatches**
- **Problem**: Workflows referenced non-existent test directories (`tests/unit_tests`, `tests/integration_tests`)
- **Solution**: Updated paths to match actual structure (`tests/`, `tests/test_integration.py`)
- **Impact**: Tests will now run correctly

### 3. **Outdated Action Versions**
- **Problem**: Using deprecated `actions/setup-python@v4`
- **Solution**: Updated to latest versions (`@v5`) with proper caching
- **Impact**: Better performance and security

### 4. **Missing Frontend Integration**
- **Problem**: No frontend testing or building in CI
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive frontend workflow jobs
- **Impact**: Full-stack testing coverage
